# Datawarehouse Project
This is a complete Datawarehousing project which has all three layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.

## Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using MySQL to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.
## Specifications
Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues before analysis.
Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

Performed the steps below before starting with the project in MySQL-
* Created a complete Project plan in Notion.
* Draw the data architecture using the Draw.io application.
* Upload the datasets to your local machine.
* Wrote SQL scripts for creating Bronze, Silver, and Gold databases in MySQL Workbench.
* Wrote DDL scripts for creating tables in the Bronze layer.
* Loaded the data from the local machine to the tables in the Bronze layer.
* Validated the data from the original CSV files with the data in the tables.
